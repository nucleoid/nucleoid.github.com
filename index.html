          <p class="c8"><span class="c3">IT professional with over 20 years of experience and knowledge in Information Technology of every form, 19 of the years as a developer. Concentrating on all stages of web development, application frameworks, and fresh technologies with a good appetite for learning. I consider communication and customer service key to an organization's success.</span></p>          <h1 class="c10"><span class="c1">Work History</span></h1>

          <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Most client work (100% remote) now includes ASP.Net MVC/WebAPI with C# (and vanilla ASP.Net) for a company called Workotter (soon to be PrismPPM) that does resource/project/portfolio management. I worked on an upgrade path for their aging code base (ASP.Net and classic ASP) to get it up to speed with current frameworks and technologies. I am now working on implementing that upgrade path. I also built a proper RESTful token-based API for them as many of their customers were asking for one. Previous work included Ruby on Rails and Java development for a company called TapInfluence concentrating on back end functionality and web services with some front end and Javascript sprinkled in on a Scrum team. Other previous contract work included new functionality and support development in .NET MVC for Avenue Right in a remote capacity. I also created and maintained an Android application called Fast Photo Notes and Fast Photo Notes Pro.</span></p>
